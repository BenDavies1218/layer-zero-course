# 🎮 LayerZero OApp Challenges

Welcome to the LayerZero Challenge Arena! Test your cross-chain skills through various missions that will take you from novice messenger boy to an omnichain master.

Each challenge focuses on one or more of the lessons. Some challenges involve exploiting vulnerable Oapp contracts, while others require building solutions to problems.
